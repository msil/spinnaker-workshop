 *  \brief Bit field manipulation.
 *
 *  \details A bit field is a vector of machine words which is
 *    treated as a vector of bits.
 *
 *    For SpiNNAker each machine word is 32 bits, and so a
 *    bit_field for each neuron (assuming 256 neurons)
 *    would be 8 words long.
 *
 *    The API includes:
 *
 *     - bit_field_test (b, n)
 *         returns true of false depending on whether bit n is set or clear
 *     - bit_field_set (b, n) / bit_field_clear (b, n)
 *         used to set or clear bit n
 *     - not_bit_field (b, s)
 *         logically inverts a bit field of size s.
 *     - and_bit_field / or_bit_field
 *         logically ands/ors two bit_fields together. Requires size.
 *     - clear_bit_field/set_bit_field
 *         Initializes bit_field with all false (= clear) or true (= set).
 *         Requires size.
 *
 *    There are also support functions for:
 *     
 *     - printing
 *     - randomly setting up a bit field
